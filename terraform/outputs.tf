    Everything installs and starts itself. Nothing to run by hand.

    Open:  http://${aws_instance.server.public_ip}:5000

    Allow two to three minutes: package install, ${var.calibrate ? "a 60s idle baseline calibration on each agent, " : ""}then the
    first pushes. The Instance toggle appears once two agents are reporting.

    Press "Stress all" to put the fleet under load and watch the smaller sizes
    separate from the larger ones.

    If a size never appears:
      ssh ubuntu@<ip> 'sudo tail -50 /var/log/syshealth-bootstrap.log'
      ssh ubuntu@<ip> 'sudo journalctl -u syshealth -n 50'

    History lives in the server's memory, capped at one hour per instance, and
    is lost if the server restarts. Fine for a few days of spot-checking; not a
    record you can go back through.

    These five instances bill until you stop them:
      terraform destroy
