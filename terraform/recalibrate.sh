# Re-measure every agent's idle baseline, on boxes that are actually idle.
#
# Baselines are taken once, for 60 seconds, at first boot — immediately after
# apt-get and a git clone, while the box is still settling. Ubuntu's apt-daily
# and unattended-upgrades timers fire around then too. On a t3.micro there is no
# headroom to absorb that, so the "idle" floor is recorded far too high.
#
# Every state on the dashboard is a ratio against that floor, so an inflated
# baseline makes the most stressed machine read HEALTHY. Re-running the
# measurement on a quiet box is the fix.
#
# Nothing may be under load while this runs, or the load becomes the baseline.
