Could not reach $URL/series.

Two usual reasons, in order of likelihood:

  1. Your address changed, and the security group still names the old one.
     Compare:  curl -4 -s ifconfig.me
     against:  ssh_cidr in terraform.tfvars
     If they differ, update the file and 'terraform apply' again — only the
     security group rules change, the instances are left alone.

  2. The server is still installing. Give it two or three minutes from apply,
     then:  \$(terraform output -raw dashboard_url) is up when this answers.
     ssh ubuntu@$(terraform output -json instances 2>/dev/null | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["dashboard"]["public_ip"])' 2>/dev/null) 'sudo journalctl -u syshealth-server -n 50'
